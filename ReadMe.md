Hi Everyone, This is a python package designed for IO API Calls.

How to use it:

Below listed are the modules we have,
    - Projects
    - Policies
    - Users

    Import the module as shown below,

        From mypackage import projects

        This will import the projects module from the io lib package, you can use this for access the api's for project creation and listing.

Detail documentation of functions will be available in the Docs Folder.

Thank you!. Happy Coding.
